# AutoCrat - Code Typer

AutoCrat is a desktop application that automates typing text with customizable start and write delays. It uses Python's `pyautogui` for simulating keyboard inputs and `tkinter` for the GUI.

## Features

- Customizable start and write delays.
- Easy-to-use GUI built with `tkinter`.
- Virtual environment setup for dependency management.
- Cross-platform support for macOS and Windows.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Git installed on your system.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anntmishra/AutoCrat.git
   cd AutoCrat
   ```

2. **Run the Setup Script**:
   - On macOS or Linux:
     ```bash
     chmod +x setup_autotyper.sh
     ./setup_autotyper.sh
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```powershell
     ./setup_autotyper.sh
     ```

This script will:

- Check for Python and create a virtual environment.
- Verify the installation of Git.
- Clone or update the repository.
- Install the necessary Python dependencies (`pyautogui` and `tk`).
- Create a desktop shortcut to launch the application.

## Usage

1. **Start the Application**:

   - On macOS: Double-click the `AutoCrat.app` icon on your Desktop.
   - On Windows: Double-click the `AutoCrat.lnk` shortcut on your Desktop.

   - Enter the write delay (seconds) in the provided text box.

3. **Type Your Text**:
   - Enter the text you want to automate typing for in the main text area.
   - Click the "Start Typing" button to begin the automated typing.
   - To stop typing, click the "Stop Typing" button.
